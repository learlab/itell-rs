Introduction
------------

The Confined Space Entry standard is designed to help prevent illness and injuries to personnel, damage to property or adverse environmental impact when personnel are performing work in confined spaces. Confined Spaces are defined as spaces large enough and so configured that personnel can bodily enter and perform assigned work, have limited or restricted means for entry or exit and are not designed for continuous occupancy. This standard defines the requirements for Confined Space Entry

## Requirements {#Requirements-164pt}

The following sections provide minimum requirements for Confined Space Entry as well as supporting guidance to clarify the intent of those requirements.

* Requirements of this Standard **shall** be met.
* Guidance in this Standard **may** be used as an aid to develop local documents that meet or exceed Control of Work (CoW) requirements. If examples are provided within guidance sections, they are not meant to represent the only acceptable means for meeting a requirement. BUs may develop or utilize other suitable methods not discussed in this document as long as the requirements are met. Implementation of guidance is not auditable.

## Requirement 1 {#Requirement-1-686t .sr-only}

### Requirement 1

Controls shall be in place to prevent unauthorized entry into confined spaces.

* Openings large enough to allow a person to enter a permit-required confined space and is readily accessible under normal conditions, shall be visibly identified as a confided space when the attendant is not present. (e.g., signage or other effective means of communication)

<Info title="Guidance">
a. When feasible, the entry opening should be closed, covered, and secured.  <br /> <br/>
b. When entrance openings cannot be closed and secured, openings should be guarded by a railing, temporary cover, or other temporary barrier that will prevent entry or an accidental fall through the opening and that will protect each employee working in the space from foreign objects entering the space.  <br /> <br/>
c. Signage should be affixed at the location, warning of the confined space. The following or similar text should be displayed on the sign: “DANGER CONFINED SPACE, DO NOT ENTER”.  <br /> <br/>
d. In facilities with similar, recognizable, or multiple confined spaces (such as storage tank facilities or workplaces with multiple manholes), BUs may identify such spaces with facility signage.  <br /> <br/>
e. If a confined space has a locked entry cover or panel, or an access door that can only be opened with tools, the use of signs may not be required.
</Info>

## Requirement 2 - 4 {#Requirement-2-4-687t .sr-only}

### Requirement 2

BUs shall identify and evaluate their confined spaces to determine those that are permit-required confined spaces.

* Entries into Confined Spaces with Hazardous Characteristics shall require a Confined Space Entry Permit

### Requirement 3

A Hazard Analysis shall be conducted in accordance with the Hazard Analysis OE Standard when planning work involving Confined Space Entry.

### Requirement 4

The Hazard Analysis and/or CoW documentation shall address the following elements:

1.  Identification of significant potential hazards from task, space, and simultaneous operations (SIMOPS) in area. 
2.  Internal configuration, obstructions, or unique hazards associated with the space (e.g., fall hazards, residues, and contaminants, etc.). 
3.  Acceptable entry conditions (e.g., oxygen concentration, %LEL, toxics). 
4.   Appropriate air ventilation (e.g., continuous forced, local exhaust, etc.). 
5.  Verification of acceptable entry conditions for duration of entry (e.g., acceptable gas testing frequency). 
6.   Positive Physical Isolation of hazardous energy in accordance with Isolation of Hazardous Energy OE Standard. 
7.   Equipment appropriately rated for the space to be used (e.g., electrical equipment rated for the area classification) and mitigating controls for such equipment as necessary (e.g., Hot Work permit). 
8.  Specialized equipment (e.g., respiratory equipment, rescue equipment, ingress and egress equipment, etc.). 
9.  Personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements.
10. Heat stress safeguards (e.g., work/rest breaks, specialty PPE) as necessary.

## Requirements 5-7 {#Requirements-5-7-688t .sr-only}

### Requirement 5

Permit Required Work Authorization shall be required for entry into Permit-Required Confined Spaces.

* BUs shall determine the level of Work Authorization required for entry into Non-Permit Required Confined Spaces and/or Reclassified Confined Spaces.

### Requirement 6

Gas testing shall be required prior to Confined Space Entry in accordance with the Portable Gas Detection OE Standard.

* Authorized entrants and/or their representatives shall have the right to observe any gas monitoring/testing of Confined Spaces.
* If gas testing indicates changed conditions, work must stop, employees must evacuate the space and the space must be re-evaluated to address the changed conditions before work may resume.

### Requirement 7

Additional controls shall be in place when work is performed in Permit-Required Confined Spaces including:

1.  A rescue team and appropriate rescue equipment 
2.  Attendant
3.  Entry Supervisor 
4.  Appropriate air ventilation 
5.  Isolation of hazardous energy in accordance with the Isolation of Hazardous Energy OE Standard
6.  Entry log maintained

<Info title="Guidance">
A third party may be utilized to fulfill these roles.  <br /> <br/>
Ventilation could potentially include natural ventilation, or forced air ventilation (power fans, eductors, air conditioning, portable air blowers, weld fume extractors, etc.).
</Info>

## Requirements 8 {#Requirements-8-690t .sr-only}

### Requirement 8

Rescue plans shall be developed for Permit-Required Confined Space Entry. At a minimum, the rescue plans shall include the following: 

1.  Rescue methods to be used in the following order of preference: 
    * Self-rescue
    * Non-entry rescue using retrieval device
    * Entry rescue
2.  Non-entry retrieval systems shall be utilized by authorized entrants (e.g., chest or full body harness with a retrieval line or wristlets). 
    * If the system increases the overall risk of the entry, or does not increase the safety of the task, it is acceptable to waive the requirement. 
    * The BU shall have a process for evaluating and approving this exception. 

1.  Means of communicating the need for rescue. 
2.  Requirements that rescue personnel are trained, properly equipped, and follow established procedures specific to the potential hazards of the Confined Space. 
3.  Availability of at least one member of the rescue team or service who is trained and competent in basic first aid and CPR. 
4.  Ability of rescuer to reach the victim(s) within a time frame that is appropriate for the permit space hazard(s) identified. 
5.  Provide the rescue personnel access to the space from which rescue may be necessary. 
6.  Availability of mechanical devices to retrieve personnel from vertical spaces more than 5 feet (1.52 m) deep. 
7.  Method to verify the competency of rescue personnel. 

<Info title="Guidance">
BUs should verify training and competency of rescuers prior to Confined Space Entry. Methods to verify competency could include training documents, drill records (training drill performed at a minimum annually), etc. <br /> <br/>
Rescue teams should be provided the opportunity to assess the physical confined space as necessary (potentially including entry) prior to the Confined Space entry work to be performed, as well as any other available information that may assist in developing the rescue plan (e.g., P&IDs, drawings, etc.).  <br /> <br/>
BUs may have some of the above requirements listed in their Emergency Action Plan, training and competency process, COEM, or part of their permitting process. If the information is documented in another document, the information does not need to be listed on the Rescue Plan itself.
</Info>

3.  Affected personnel shall be notified that the space has been reclassified.
4.  Documentation, including updated hazard analysis, authorizing the space to be reclassified shall be approved.

If special hazardous characteristics arise in a reclassified confined space, all authorized entrants shall exit the confined space, and the space shall be reevaluated to determine how it will be classified.
